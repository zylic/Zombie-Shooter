# Zombie-Shooter

Game made by me in Windows Forms that was heavily inspired by Call Of Duty Zombies. None of the assets are mine and they belong to Treyarch & Activision.
This was the trello I made for things work in progress and things ive already done.

Note: I've pretty much completely dropped this project due to limitations with Windows Forms and how terribly it starts lagging when multiple things are moving at once.

Game was super work in progress but everything works and the game is playable with 1 map, 4 working perks, a performance mode, power ups, save files, a semi working level system and wall buys.

How to launch the game:
1. Go to \ZombieShooter\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows
2. Launch ZombieShooter.exe
3. :)
